## üî¥ Critical Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contract

**Option A: Using Remix IDE (Recommended for beginners)**

1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

2. Create a new file `SneakerNFT.sol` and paste the code from `contracts/SneakerNFT.sol`

3. Install OpenZeppelin contracts:
   - In Remix, go to File Explorer
   - Create folder `@openzeppelin/contracts`
   - Or use the Remix plugin manager to install OpenZeppelin

4. Compile the contract:
   - Go to "Solidity Compiler" tab
   - Select compiler version 0.8.0 or higher
   - Click "Compile SneakerNFT.sol"

5. Deploy to Filecoin Calibration:
   - Go to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Change Environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Make sure MetaMask is connected to Filecoin Calibration testnet:
     - Network Name: `Filecoin Calibration`
     - RPC URL: `https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`
     - Chain ID: `314159`
     - Currency Symbol: `tFIL`
     - Block Explorer: `https://calibration.filscan.io/`
   
6. Get test FIL:
   - Go to [Filecoin Calibration Faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/)
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Request test FIL

7. Deploy:
   - Select "SneakerNFT" contract
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - **Copy the deployed contract address**

**Option B: Using Hardhat**

See detailed instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

1. Open `.env.local`

2. Replace the contract address:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SNEAKER_NFT_CONTRACT=0xYourDeployedContractAddressHere
```

3. Save the file

4. Restart the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/store
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the header
   - Select MetaMask
   - Make sure you're on Filecoin Calibration testnet

2. **Upload Image**
   - Click "Choose File" and select a sneaker image
   - Click "Upload to IPFS"
   - Wait for upload to complete
   - You'll see the uploaded image and IPFS CID

3. **Fill NFT Details**
   - Enter Sneaker Name (e.g., "Air Jordan 1 Retro High")
   - Enter Brand (e.g., "Nike")
   - Enter Price (e.g., "15000" for $150.00)

4. **Mint NFT**
   - Click "Mint as NFT" button
   - **MetaMask popup will appear** - this is what you were asking about!
   - Review the transaction details
   - Click "Confirm" in MetaMask
   - Wait for transaction confirmation (you'll see "Confirming..." state)

5. **View Success**
   - After confirmation, you'll see:
     - "NFT Minted Successfully!" message
     - Transaction hash
     - Your uploaded image
     - Buttons to "Mint Another NFT" or "View Dashboard"

6. **Check Dashboard**
   - Click "View Dashboard" or go to http://localhost:3000/nft-dashboard
   - You should see your newly minted NFT
   - Image carousel if you add multiple images later

## üéØ Current Status

### Working ‚úÖ
- Image upload to IPFS (Lighthouse API key configured)
- Wallet connection (WalletConnect configured)
- NFT metadata form
- Transaction triggering logic
- Success/error handling
- Dashboard UI

### Pending ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Smart contract deployment** (blocks all minting)
- Contract address configuration in `.env.local`
- Full flow testing with real blockchain transactions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Showing Transaction

**Symptoms**: Clicking "Mint as NFT" doesn't open MetaMask

**Possible Causes**:
1. ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Contract address is `0x0000...0000` 
   - The app now shows an alert if contract is not deployed
   - Deploy the contract and update `.env.local`

2. Wrong network in MetaMask
   - Make sure you're on Filecoin Calibration (Chain ID: 314159)
   - Add the network manually if needed (see Step 1 above)

3. Wallet not connected
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the header
   - Make sure you see your address in the navbar

4. Missing form fields
   - All fields (Sneaker Name, Brand, Price) must be filled
   - Button will be disabled if any field is empty

### Transaction Fails

**Check**:
1. Do you have enough test FIL for gas fees?
   - Get more from the faucet
2. Is the contract address correct in `.env.local`?
3. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
4. Check MetaMask for rejected/failed transactions

### Image Not Displaying

**Check**:
1. IPFS CID is valid (starts with "Qm" or "bafy")
2. Gateway URL is accessible: `https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/{CID}`
3. Image file format is supported (jpg, png, gif)

## üìù Code Flow

### Upload Flow
```
1. User selects file ‚Üí handleFileChange()
2. File preview generated ‚Üí setPreviewUrl()
3. Click "Upload to IPFS" ‚Üí uploadToLighthouse()
4. File uploaded via Lighthouse SDK
5. CID received ‚Üí setUploadedCID()
6. Success card shows with image
```

### Minting Flow
```
1. User fills form ‚Üí setSneakerName/Brand/Price()
2. Click "Mint as NFT" ‚Üí mintNFT()
3. Validate all fields present
4. Check contract deployed (if 0x000...000, alert and exit)
5. Create metadata JSON
6. Upload metadata to IPFS ‚Üí get metadataURI
7. Call writeContract() with params:
   - sneakerName
   - brand
   - [imageURI] (array of one image)
   - price (converted to BigInt * 100)
   - metadataURI
8. MetaMask popup appears ‚Üí user confirms
9. Transaction submitted ‚Üí setMinting(true)
10. Wait for confirmation ‚Üí isConfirming = true
11. Confirmed ‚Üí setMintedTokenId(hash)
12. Success screen shows
```
